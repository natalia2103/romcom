# Project RomCom

> A website for the creative romantic.

Contributor: natalia2103


About the Website
--------

This website allows users to get creative with romance novel covers! Users can use the navigation buttons at the top to generate a new random cover, save their favorites, view those saved covers, and also create and save their own romance novel covers.



See it for Yourself!
-------------------

[click here](https://github.com/natalia2103/romcom.git) to view the project on GitHub and follow these instructions:
- Fork the repository
- Clone down your new, forked, repository
- `cd` into the repository
- Run open `index.html` to view the project in the browser


Technologies Used
-------------

To work on this project, I used the terminal on my Mac to access the repo I cloned down from GitHub. I used Atom as my text editor, and used GitHub to track the changes I made. I used JavaScript to interact with the HTML by utilizing the DOM in order to make this page more interactive.


Future Additions
--------------------

In the future, I would like to add more functionality to the page.  When users see a cover or create a cover they love, they can then save that cover to their other fantastic covers under the "View Covers" view by clicking the "Save Cover" button. I think it would be fun to add an option on the 'Create Your Own Cover' form to have a drop down for each input that would allow users to choose from the existing arrays of covers, titles, and descriptors to create a cover to their liking.
