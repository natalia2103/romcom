# Project RomCom

> A website for the creative romantic.

About
--------

This website allows users to get creative with romance novel covers! Users can use the navigation buttons at the top to generate a new random cover, save their favorites, view those saved covers, and also create and save their own romance novel covers.

I used JavaScript to interact with the HTML by utilizing the DOM in order to make this page more interactive.

You can now open this browser by running open index.html in your terminal

Future Additions
--------------------

In the future, I would like to add more functionality to the page. Improvements can be made by adding functionality to the form under the "Make You Own Cover" view. This would make it possible for users to get really creative and come up with the themes for their own romance novel and save that cover to their other fantastic covers under the "View Covers" view by clicking "Make My Book".
